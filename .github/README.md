Fork of https://github.com/nwtnni/facet that adds the ability to target multiple outcomes. Useful when multiple stones will work well, for example 7/6 or 6/7 or 9/5 or 5/9 on an alt. Also useful for cutting a 9/7 due to adding 7/9 moves as valid targets. 

Mirrored stones like 7/7 have the same results as upstream.

UI changes reflect my personal preferences while cutting stones in-game.
